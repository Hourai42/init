Well, when I nslookup my ip address at this computer (10.112.7.26), 
it gives me this as a result. 

Server:		10.51.1.253
Address:	10.51.1.253#53

26.7.112.10.in-addr.arpa	name = e1z2r7p26.42.us.org.

The IP address of the DNS server used in my case is 10.51.1.253.

The correct answer for this is "/etc/resolv.conf"
