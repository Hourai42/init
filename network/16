I'm assuming to make the 46.19.122.85 address reroute to 
intra.42.fr, I'll have to edit the /etc/hosts file(in which I do not have
any write permissions) and set 46.19.122.85 to intra.42.fr. 

So the setup of the file is
 
127.0.0.1       localhost
255.255.255.255 broadcasthost
::1             localhost

10.51.1.38 	cdn.intra.42.fr

So possibly changing 10.51.1.38 to 46.19.122.85 would do the job.
