dig -x 10.51.1.81 gives me the name of the server linked to 10.51.1.81 and its IP address.
I could use "hostname" for the same result though, I believe. 

With hostname, I get e1z2r7p26.42.us.org.
With dig, I get the server's IP: 10.51.1.253#53(10.51.1.253) as well as the names, being
dpm-master.42.us.org and dhcp-dns.42.us.org. 
Reverse DNS is simply the reverse of DNS-- instead of getting an IP address from a domain, it
gets a domain from an IP address. 

nslookup 10.51.1.81 will also get the server name, which is dpm-master.42.us.org. 

So basically, the answer is "dpm-master.42.us.org".
